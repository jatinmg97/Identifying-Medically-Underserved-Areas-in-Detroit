# Identifying-Medically-Underserved-Areas-in-Detroit

In this project we aim to identify the major causes that affect the life expectancy in Detroit.

We compared the Michigan Average Obseity with different states as well as the National obesity rate.

We identified various hospital locations in detroit and verified if there was a relationship between that and the medically underserved areas.
